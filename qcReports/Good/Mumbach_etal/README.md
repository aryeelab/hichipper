# Original Samples
Descriptions of files that were analyzed as part of the original data present in [original
HiChIP paper](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmeth.3999.html). 
Notably, these sample's QC metrics are very consistent and appear to be of high quality as the 
proportion of long range interactions exceeds 20 percent.

# Variable Cell Inputs
Compiled HTML for [1 million](https://cdn.rawgit.com/aryeelab/hichipper/master/qcReports/Good/Mumbach_etal/1mil.hichipper.qcreport.html) [5 million](https://cdn.rawgit.com/aryeelab/hichipper/master/qcReports/Good/Mumbach_etal/5mil.hichipper.qcreport.html) [10 million](https://cdn.rawgit.com/aryeelab/hichipper/master/qcReports/Good/Mumbach_etal/10mil.hichipper.qcreport.html)

While each sample looks mostly successful, we note the lower proportion of long range interactions in the 5 million cell count relative 
to the other samples. As the 1 million cell sample looks slightly better, we cannot determine, at least from these samples,
that reduced cellular input has a direct effect on library quality. A comparison side-by-side was put in the "Noteworthy" folder, 
and the [compiled HTML is here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/aryeelab/hichipper/master/qcReports/Noteworthy/cellInput.hichipper.html).
