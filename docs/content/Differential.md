# Finding differential loops

Have you generated a bunch of HiChIP samples and want to see what's different between them? Check out
the [diffloop vignette](https://rpubs.com/caleblareau/diffloop_vignette) for an example analysis
comparing loops from ChIA-PET (a similar 3C method to HiChIP) between K562 and MCF-7. Installation
instructions for this package are shown in the [dependencies](http://hichipper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/Dependencies.html) section.
